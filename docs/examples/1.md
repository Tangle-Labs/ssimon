# Getting Started

To instantiate an instance of SSIMON, you need to pass it an adapter, and a storage.

- adapter: used to figure out how to interact with the DID method
- storage: used to store secrets, and configuration information about that identity data

## Storage

The storage which you need to pass to SSIMON, needs to be compatible with the StorageSpec, either you can implement a storage of your own (example use case would be wanting to interact with a custom network) or use a generic store

### Implementing Own Interface

you can implement your own Storage by

```ts
import { StorageSpec } from "@tanglelabs/ssimon";

export class MyStorage implements StorageSpec {
    ...
}
```

### Using the GenericStore

generic store is a basic implementation of the storage driver which can take a reader and a writer function and then create a StorageSpec compatible instance

Example implementation for a filesystem store

```ts
import { GenericStore, encryptWithAES } from "@tanglelabs/ssimon";
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";

const constructFileStore = ({
  path,
  password,
}: {
  path: string;
  password: string;
}) => {
  /**
   * FS writer
   */
  const writer = async (body: string) => {
    await writeFile(path, body);
  };

  /**
   * FS Reader
   */
  const reader = async () => {
    const data = await readFile(path).catch(async (e) => {
      if (e.code === "ENOENT") {
        const encryptedEmptyArray = encryptWithAES("[]", password);
        await writer(encryptedEmptyArray);
        return encryptedEmptyArray;
      }
      throw new Error();
    });

    return data.toString();
  };

  /**
   * Construct a new FS Store and return
   */

  const store = new GenericStore({ path, password, reader, writer });
  return store;
};
```

## Instantiating The Manager

to instantiate identity manager we can consume any adapter, the example below consumes the `did:key` adapter

```ts
import {
  GenericStore,
  IdentityManager,
  encryptWithAES,
} from "@tanglelabs/ssimon";
import path from "path";
import { DidKeyAdapter } from "@tanglelabs/key-identity-adapter";

export async function getIdentityManager() {
  // create a new storage using the FS Storage Builder
  // the path specified here, would be where all the encrypted identity data is stored
  const storage = constructFileStore({
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, `./identity`),
    password: "asdf",
  });

  // Create a new IdentityManger Instance
  const manager = await IdentityManager.build({
    adapter: DidKeyAdapter,
    storage,
  });

  return manager;
}
```

# DID Account Basics

> this example, assumes you have already gone through the first example of creating a manager instance and further expands on that.

DID Account, Referred to as `IdentityAccount`, is a utility class which contains all the functions a did might ever need to use

## Creating a new DID

to create a new DID, we can use the existing manager instance and invoke the createDid method

```ts
// import the `getIdentityManager` and `constructFileStore` functions here

async function createDid() {
  const manager = await getIdentityManager();

  // this storage is used to store credentials for a particular DID
  const identityStore = constructFileStore({
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "./mydid-store"),
    password: "foopass",
  });

  const myDid = await manager.createDid({
    // alias is a human readable nickname you can give to this id, in a regular
    // usecase this can be used to tie a DID to a username or a userId
    alias: "myDid",
    store: identityStore,
  });
}
```

## Getting an existing DID

if you want to retrieve an already existing DID, then you can do so using the `getDid` method
the `getDid` method can take either `alias` or the `did`, where the `did` is the did identifier such as `(did:method:<foo-bar>)`.

The method loads an existing DID stored on the disk in the store provided previously to identity manager

```ts
async function getDid({ alias, did }: { alias?: string; did?: string }) {
  const manager = await getIdentityManager();

  // this storage is used to store credentials for a particular DID
  const identityStore = constructFileStore({
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "./mydid-store"),
    password: "foopass",
  });

  const myDid = await manager.getDid({
    // ONLY ONE out of did and alias needs to be passed here
    alias,
    did,
    store: identityStore,
  });
}
```

# Managing Credentials

> The following examples use `myDid` as an example of an instantiated `IdentityAccount`

Credentials management is two-fold with SSIMON, for credentials that you issue to others and for credentials that are issued to you, for the credentials that you receive, i.e. are the holder for, all the methods can be found in `myDid.credentials.store`, wherein you can find all the CRUD methods for managing your own credentials. Operations for Credentials which you issue are found directly in `myDid.credentials`

## Issuer Operations

### Creating and Issuing a Credential

A credential to be issued can be created as below, issuance of the credential to a user is OOB for this library and is handled by [@tanglelabs/oid4vc]("https://github.com/tangle-labs/oid4vc")

```ts
async function issueCredential() {
  const credential = await myDid.credentials.create({
    // did of the recipient of the credential
    recipientDid: "did:asdf:asdfasdfasdfasdf",

    // unique identifier to give to the credential
    id: "https://tanglelabs.io/credentials/123",

    // Body of the credential, can be a custom object
    body: {
      name: "Alice",
      gpa: 4.9,
      graduationYear: 2023,
    },

    // index of the key to sign with, if confused set to 0
    keyIndex: 0,

    // Type of the Credential as an array
    type: ["UniversityCredential"],
  });
}
```

### Verifying a Credential

SSIMON leverages DVID (Domain Verified Identity) which ties a domain to a DID, essentially we add a second check to ensure that the domain which claims to be issuing the credential has actually issued the credential or not, therefore our result for verification looks like this

```ts
{
    DVID: true,
    vc: true
}
```

essentially `DVID` is true when the domain has a valid DVID record and is tied to the DID issuing the credential, and the `vc` is true when the signature on the credential is valid

to verify a credential you can use the verify method

```ts
async function verifyCredential(credential: Record<string, any> | string) {
  const result = await myDid.credentials.verify(credential);

  if (!result.DVID || !result.vc) throw new Error("VC not valid");
}
```

## Holder Operations

Your `IdentityAccount` always comes with a store where you can store your credentials, which you can access under `myDid.credentials.store`

the store gives you the following methods

| Method                                                      | Purpose                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `myDid.credentials.store.create(rawCredential)`             | store a new credential         |
| `myDid.credentials.store.findOne(filter)`                   | find one credential            |
| `myDid.credentials.store.findMany(filter)`                  | find many credentials          |
| `myDid.credentials.store.findOneAndUpdate(filter, newBody)` | find one credential and update |
| `myDid.credentials.store.findOneAndDelete(filter)`          | find one credential and delete |
